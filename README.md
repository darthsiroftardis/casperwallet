## An application to manage keys

### Getting started
The application uses a MongoDB database to store the keys that you generate. Install MongodDB service so that you can store the keys within the database.

### Using the application
Currently the functionality supported is very limited. You can create and load users from a database. There will be cryptographic signing functionaility soon.

### TODO
* Add transaction signing functionaility
* Add key delegation
